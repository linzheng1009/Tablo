# Tablo
A simple cross-tab generator with charts creation function.

## Author's Notes
* This streamlit app has not been deployed to the public yet (you may see the picture for the interface of the app).
* This crosstab generator is able to convert your survey data into crosstabs in a nick of time.
* Depending on the number of survey questions containing in the survey data ; if there are 6 survey questions, the output will be 6 worksheets with each containing the crosstab of each survey question.
* Additionally, __Tablo__ is able to create simple bar charts for you too.
* After you have gotten the output csv file from the creation of crosstabs, re-upload this output file in the visualisation step and __Tablo__ will clear your burden of this tedious task.

## Disclaimers
* The author does not assume any responsibility that __Tablo__ will always work the way you intended it to work.
* __Tablo__ has not gone through a thorough process in order to be commercialised so use it at your own risk.
